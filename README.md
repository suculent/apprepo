# Installation

Install the gem

    sudo gem install apprepo

Make sure, you have the latest version of the Xcode command line tools installed:

    xcode-select --install

# Quick Start

The guide will create all the necessary files for you, using the existing app metadata from iTunes Connect.

- ```cd [your_project_folder]```
- ```apprepo init``` (not supported yet)
- Enter your AppRepo credentials (path to RSA private key)
- Enter your `APPCODE` for this app in AppRepo
- Enjoy a good drink, while the computer does all the work for you

From now on, you can run `apprepo` to deploy a new update, or just upload new app metadata and icons.
